# ATS Resume Scoring

This project provides an AI-powered platform for scoring resumes against job descriptions using advanced language models and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). It helps job seekers optimize their resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and assists recruiters in evaluating candidate fit.

## Features

- **Resume Parsing:** Extracts and processes resume content from PDF files.
- **Job Description Analysis:** Analyzes job descriptions to identify key requirements.
- **ATS Scoring:** Scores resumes based on their relevance to job descriptions using AI agents.
- **Recommendations:** Provides actionable suggestions to improve resume ATS compatibility.
- **RAG Integration:** Uses a local Chroma database for document retrieval and context enrichment.
- **Streamlit UI:** Interactive web interface for uploading resumes and viewing results.
